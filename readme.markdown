# Database Starter: Bug Tracker

We're exploring a new island, and we want to keep track of all the weird and
interesting insects we find.

Here are our models:

+ Researchers - These are the grad students who find insects
+ Insects - These are the insects themselves
+ Papers - A researcher may write many papers, each about an insect

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. `rake db:create`
3. `rake db:migrate`
4. Run `main.rb`
